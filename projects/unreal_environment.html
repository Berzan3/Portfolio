            <p>The materials and textures were not made by me but imported from my university.
                When the building parts were done it was time to make the scene in Unreal engine.
            </p>

            <p>
                I made two different vertex paint materials one for building walls and one for the house foundation.
            </p>
            <br />

            <div class="media-grid">
                <div class="media-item">

            </div>

            <p>
                I made five different particle effects: torchfire, bonfire, fireflies, chimneysmoke and candle-light.
            </p>
            <br />

            <div class="media-grid">
                <div class="media-item">

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>
                The torchfire effect is very similar to bonfire, just slimmer, smaller and dimmer light.
            </p>
            <br />

            <div class="media-item">
                <img src="../assets/unreal_environment/particles2.png" alt="particles 2">

            <div class="media-item">
                <img src="../assets/unreal_environment/moons.PNG" alt="moons">
            </div>

            <p>
                The moons are two massive spheres with a transparent plane behind them that radiates a glow.
                They also have a script that makes them always face the player,
                so if the player moves far into a direction the moons still look realistic.
            </p>
            <br />

            After I was pleased about how my scene looked with all the different post-process effects I recorded the video you can see at the top.
            The sounds are not made by me but imported.
            I had some trouble first with the grass flickering and not loading in properly when I filmed but that was fixed by giving
            the camera some starter frames to load in everything before starting to film.

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                The biggest and only challenge for me during this project was modeling and uv-mapping.
                I had to simplify my design off the buildings because it would have taken too much time off the course to do the whole project.
            </p>

        <div class="detail-section">
            <h3>Iteration</h3>
            <p>
                This was a fun project to do and I didn´t stumble onto many problems during my work.
                I learned how to do basic modeling, uv-mapping and how to make a beautiful scene in Unreal engine.
